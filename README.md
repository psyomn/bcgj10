Topic: One Weapon - Many Uses

## Idea: the unsuspecting murder weapon.

Maybe we can do something with common household items. Many household items can
be used for one job, but can also be used as weapons.

## Idea: manipulation

* silvertongue can fuck up things

## Idea: How are you going to die in the room?

You are left in a room with a weapon...
* is the gun the weapon?
* is th room the weapon?
* is isolation the weapon?

or an escape room:

* one puzzle leads to another room, and gives you another weaponn
* everything leads you to the final thing that you uncover, and you are finally
  free
