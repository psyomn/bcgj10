SEGMENT 1

                         HECTOR
            Well, hello princess. Nice of you to
            join me. I was starting to wonder when
            you'd come around, but you made it.
            Well done. Let's get the formalities
            out of the way, yeah?

[ no action / response | check room | check items ]

                         HECTOR
            The strong, silent type, huh? That's
            okay. I can definitely work with that.
            I'd offer you the deluxe tour, but it
            seems unnecessary and I suspect you're
            smart enough to have figured this out.

                         HECTOR
            You're trapped in a room and clearly
            at the mercy of the wrong type of
            person to be expecting any mercy from.
            Like most disappointments in life,
            there is a way out, but it requires
            some effort on your part. The key to
            getting out is in this room.

[ where's the key? | where am I? | no keyhole ]

DECISION 1.1 - WHERE IS THE KEY?

                         HECTOR
            I expected a bit more from you. We did,
            after all, just go over this. The key
            to your exit, and I know this might
            come as a bit of shock, is in this
            room. I'm going to need you to pay a
            bit closer attention.

DECISION 1.2 - WHY AM I HERE?

                         HECTOR
            Influence. Yours and others. Are you
            familiar with the Stanford Prison
            Experiment?

[ yes | no | ... ]

DECISION 1.2.1 - YES

                         HECTOR
            Will wonders never cease?

DECISION 1.2.2 - NO | ...

                         HECTOR
            It's the kind of experiment you
            couldn't really do today. Not in the
            the light, at least. It still amuses
            how recent some of psychological
            transgressions are. Anyway, simple
            experiment. Students were brought in
            to set up a mock prison. Some of the
            student were prisoners and others were
            guards. The professor running the
            experiment placed himself in the role
            as warden. In retrospect, it's fairly
            unsurprising how quickly it started to
            degenerate.

                         HECTOR
            The Standford Prison Experiment. Abu
            Ghraib. Good ole Charlie Mason and his
            "family" members writing on the walls
            in their victim's blood. Influence
            goes a long way.

                         HECTOR
            It's interesting, sure, but it doesn't
            quite wash. Not every ghetto kid is a
            drug dealing murderer. Not ever
            politician is a backscratching
            prostitute for hire. Not every CEO is
            an image obsessed sociopath. At some
            point you have to be responsible for
            the influence you receive, but also
            for the influence you exercise.

DECISION 1.3 - NO KEYHOLE

                         HECTOR
            Well. That's certainly embarrassing.
            Let me fix that right up for you.

                         HECTOR
            Well, go ahead. Give me a hand and
            I'll get you your keyhole.

SEGMENT 2

                         HECTOR
            Hello princess. Nice of you to join me.
            I was starting to wonder when you'd
            come around. Let's get the formalities
            out of the way, yeah?

[ interrupt | check door]

DECISION 2.1 - INTERRUPT

                         HECTOR
            Influence. I hear you're a fan. We
            build up these reputations and then
            exercise them as influence. It's
            curious what we do with our influence.
            Like the notion that you're going to
            have any influence of how this goes by
            interrupting me. What I also find
            curious is what we do when our
            influence is subverted or, worse,
            completely undercut.

                         HECTOR
            Tell me, how does it feel?

[ go fuck yourself | let me out | ... ]

DECISION 2.1.1 - GO FUCK YOURSELF

                         HECTOR
            Very eloquent. I both suitably
            impressed and intimidated. Well done.

DECISION 2.1.2 - I WANT OUT

                         HECTOR
            Perfectly reasonable request.
            Logically and emotionally sound. And I
            am perfectly happy to see you go, but
            it is going to take a bit of effort on
            your behalf.

DECISION 2.1.3 - ...

                         HECTOR
            Stoic in the face of adversity. It's
            admirable. Really. Colour me impressed

DECISION 2.2 - CHECK DOOR

                         HECTOR
            The strong, silent type, huh? I can
            work with that. So, you're trapped in
            a room, at the mercy of the wrong type
            of person. There is only one way out
            and the key to doing so is in this
            room.

BUTTON 2 - REWIND

                         HECTOR
            You know, it occurs to me that
            forgetting to have a key hole may have
            just be one of the critical pieces I
            left out in my haste. It seems
            ridiculous to expect you to solve an
            incomplete puzzle, doesn't it?

[ rewind ]

                         HECTOR
            Please, go ahead. I'll get this all
            straightened out.

SEGMENT 3

                         HECTOR
            Hello, princess. Nice of you to join
            me.

[ shut up | what do you want? ]

DECISION 3.1 - SHUT UP

                         HECTOR
            It's really starting to lose its charm
            already, isn't it? I agree. It's a bit
            tired. Doesn't matter. We are well on
            our way, aren't we?

DECISION 3.2 - WHAT DO YOU WANT?

                         HECTOR
            What bring a person to a place like
            this, do you think? What brings
            someone to bring someone to a place
            like this? Take a minute. Consider it.
            What have you done that would bring
            you to a place like this? What have
            you done that would bring someone to
            bring you to a place like this?

BUTTON 3

                         HECTOR
            I know what you're thinking. "He can't
            possibly know that." But you're here,
            aren't you? So, logically, someone
            must know.

                         HECTOR
            Now, if you wouldn't mind, we haven't
            all day. Feel free to figure it all
            out. The key to your way out is right
            in front of you.

[ examine items ]

                         HECTOR
            Quite frankly, I'm a little
            disappointed it's taking you so long.
            Go ahead, let's try this again

[ rewind ]

                         HECTOR
            Please, I haven't got all day.

SEGMENT 4

                         HECTOR
            It's my little reality. You think I'd
            be much better at this. You know? It's
            so aggravating not being sure. Just
            not quite fucking getting it. So much
            of it, so much of this, is already in
            my head that it's obvious. I already
            know how this ends. What I don't know
            is what's in your head.

[ confused | insult | ... ]

                         HECTOR
            Do you just not understand? What is it?
            Don't you get it? Then again, maybe
            you do? Maybe you are perfectly clear
            on what's going on here and you are
            just fucking with me.

[ yes | no | ... ]

                         HECTOR
            How much of your work will I do for
            you? How many fucking hoops will I
            jump through?

                         HECTOR
            Or maybe I did over complicate it.
            It's hard to say. Either way, we can
            sort that out.

[ rewind ] > forced / user can't select

                         HECTOR
            Don't bother. I'll do it myself.

SEGMENT 5

                         HECTOR
            I've decided it wasn't me. It was you.
            So, I've gone ahead and pared things
            back a little. Go on. It's right there,
            just for you.

[ what happens when I leave | open box ]

DECISION 5.1 - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I LEAVE

                         HECTOR
            Nothing you need to worry about just
            yet. Please, go ahead

DECISION 5.2 - OPEN BOX

                         HECTOR
            Congratulations. You've found the key
            that leads your exit. Now, if you
            wouldn't putting that bullet into your
            head, that'd be great. Hurry now,
            before the excitement fades.

            You didn't think it's be that easy,
            did you? I can assure you, whatever
            control you think you have in this
            situation is an illusion.

[ rewind | take the exit ]

                         HECTOR
            Oh, no. That didn't fix it. Maybe the
            next try? Perhaps? Who knows? You
            could give it a go, of course. Or you
            could do what you know is right.

[ rewind | take the exit ]

                         HECTOR
            Do it! You wanted out and there's the
            exit, right in front of you. If
            someone was in the way of you getting
            out and you had that in your hand you
            would do whatever was needed to get
            them out of your way. You are in the
            way. Do what you need to do. Take the
            exit.

[ rewind | take the exit ]

                         HECTOR
            I think it's important to value time,
            but on insofar as that time itself is
            value. Is this remaining time valuable
            to you? Stuck here, running over the
            same ground? You take as long as you
            need to figure that out. I've as much
            time as you do. Truth be told,
            substantially more.
