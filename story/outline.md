# Functional Outline

Limiting the scope of this down to six major segments to make this acheiveable with the project time frame. Segment seven is largely just a repeating place holder after the main six segments have been completed. This wraps in around on itself with little to no changes.

Character actions are noted in [].

## Segment 1

* hello princess.. nice of you to join me
* small, enclosed room
* minimal furniture and a single door, no windows
* [ examine points in the room ] >> text to accompany actions
* a quick recount of the player's sins
* there's only one way out of it
* you need to find the key to that door
* the door that doesn't have a key hole on it
* well, that's embarrassing, let me fix that
* [ rewind ]

## Segment 2

* hello princess... nice of you to join me
* the same room, save that the door now has a key hole
* walk through a modified version of the previous speech
* close, but not quite perfect
* [ interrupt ]
* influence, I hear you're a fan
* it's curious, what we think of as power
* like shouting at me from you little room really makes any difference
* strengths, well, they can be our weapons.. they can also be our weaknesses
* they mark us
* you know, it occurs to me that I may have left out some critical pieces here
* [ rewind ]


## Segment 3

* hello princess... nice of you to join me
* [ "SHUT UP!"" ]
* losing it's charm already, isn't it?
* that's fine. we're well on our way
* take a look around
* I meant what I said, the key to your escape is in this room

* [ rewind ]


## Segment 4

* it's my little reality, you'd think I'd be better at this
* it's so frustrating not being sure, you know
* so much of it is in my head, I already get it.
* I don't know what you get.
* maybe you already get it.
* maybe, it's just you trying to fuck with me...

* [ rewind ]

## Segment 5

* [ rewind ]


## Segment 7

* You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?
* the room has been stripped down
* the door and any furniture is gone

* [ rewind | take the exit ]
