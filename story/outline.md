## Segment 1

#### Scene
  * small, enclosed room
  * minimal furniture and decor
  * a single door on the wall, no windows

#### Content
  * Well, hello princess. Nice of you to join me.
  * Let's get the formalities out of the way, yeah?
  * [ ... | check room | check items ]
    * -- pending room layout / floor plan
  * The strong, silent type, huh?
  * I can work with that.
  * You're smart enough to have figured this out
  * You're trapped in a room, clearly at the mercy of the wrong type of person to expect mercy from.
  * There is, of course, only one way out.
  * The key to getting out is in this room.
  * [ where is the key? | why am I here? | no keyhole ]
    * [ where is the key? ]
      * I expected a bit more from you.
      * We did, after all, just go over this.
      * The key to your exit is... wait for it.
      * In this room.
    * [ why am I here? ]
      * Influence.
      * Are you familiar with the Stanford Prison Experiment?
      * [ yes | no | ... ]
        * [ yes ]
          * Will wonders never cease?
        * [ no | ... ]
          * It's the kind of thing you couldn't do today, not in the light, anyways.
          * It's funny how recently that was.
          * Anyway, simple experiment.
          * Students set up a mock prison.
          * Some students were prisoners and others were guards.
          * The professor running the experiment put himself in as warden.
          * In retrospect, it's fairly unsurprising how quickly it
        * Standford Prison Experiment.
        * Abu Ghraid.
        * Good ole Chuck Manson's acolytes scrawling on walls in their victim's blood.
        * Influence goes a long way.
        * It's interesting, but it doesn't quite wash.
        * Not every ghetto kid is a drug dealing murderer...
        * Not every politician is a backscratching prostitute for hire...
        * Not every abused child goes on to abuse their own child...
        * At some point you have be responsible for the influence you receive
        * But also for the influence you exercise.
    * [ no keyhole ]  
      * Well, that's embarrassing. Let me fix that for you.
  * [ rewind ]
  * Well, go ahead, give me a hand. I'll fix that right up for you.

## Segment 2

#### Scene
  * the door now has a key hole on it
  * the room remains the same

#### Content
  * Well, hello princess. Nice of you to join me.
  * Formalities out of the way, yes?

  * [ interrupt | check room item | check room item ]
  * influence, I hear you're a fan
  * it's curious, what we think of as power
  * like shouting at me from you little room really makes any difference
  * strengths, well, they can be our weapons.. they can also be our weaknesses
  * they mark us
  * you know, it occurs to me that I may have left out some critical pieces here
  * [ rewind ]


## Segment 3

  * hello princess... nice of you to join me
  * [ shut up | what do you want? ]
  * It's really losing its charm already, isn't it?
  * I agree. It's a bit tired.
  * Doesn't matter. We're well on our way anyway.
  * take a look around
  * I meant what I said, the key to your escape is in this room

  * [ rewind ]


## Segment 4

  * it's my little reality, you'd think I'd be better at this
  * it's so frustrating not being sure, you know
  * so much of it is in my head, I already get it.
  * I don't know what you get.
  * maybe you already get it.
  * maybe, it's just you trying to fuck with me...

  * [ rewind ]

## Segment 5

  * hello princess... nice of you to join me
  * reset back to the first segment, the original room, missing the key hole

  * So, I've stripped things down a little
  * [ perform action | ask question ]
  * perform action >> reveals box [ open box ]
  * reveals the gun
  * Congratulations, you've found the key that leads to your exit.
  * Hurry now, before the excitement fades.
  * [ rewind ]


## Segment 7

  * You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?
  * the room has been stripped down
  * the door and any furniture is gone
  * all that is left are bare walls, a small table, and the box labelled key
  * it is open with the gun visible inside
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
  * remove the box
  * the gun sits naked on the table
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
  * remove the table
  * the gun sits on the floor of the empty room in front of the player
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
  * then all the distractions... a white room with a gun prominently in the middle of the floor
  * [ take the exit ]
  * You take as long as I need. I've got as much time as you've got. Substantially more, truth be told.

## General Collection
  * I know, you're think... he can't possible know that.
  * You're here. Somebody knows.
