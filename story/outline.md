## Segment 1

#### Scene
  * small, enclosed room
  * minimal furniture and decor
  * a single door on the wall, no windows

#### Content
  * Well, hello princess. Nice of you to join me.
  * Let's get the formalities out of the way, yeah?
  * [ ... | check room | check items ]
    * -- pending room layout / floor plan
  * The strong, silent type, huh?
  * I can work with that.
  * You're smart enough to have figured this out
  * You're trapped in a room, clearly at the mercy of the wrong type of person to expect mercy from.
  * There is, of course, only one way out.
  * The key to getting out is in this room.
  * [ where is the key? | why am I here? | no keyhole ]
    * [ where is the key? ]
      * I expected a bit more from you.
      * We did, after all, just go over this.
      * The key to your exit is... wait for it.
      * In this room.
    * [ why am I here? ]
      * Influence.
      * Are you familiar with the Stanford Prison Experiment?
      * [ yes | no | ... ]
        * [ yes ]
          * Will wonders never cease?
        * [ no | ... ]
          * It's the kind of thing you couldn't do today, not in the light, anyways.
          * It's funny how recently that was.
          * Anyway, simple experiment.
          * Students set up a mock prison.
          * Some students were prisoners and others were guards.
          * The professor running the experiment put himself in as warden.
          * In retrospect, it's fairly unsurprising how quickly it
        * Stanford Prison Experiment.
        * Abu Ghraib.
        * Good ole Chuck Manson's acolytes scrawling on walls in their victim's blood.
        * Influence goes a long way.
        * It's interesting, but it doesn't quite wash.
        * Not every ghetto kid is a drug dealing murderer...
        * Not every politician is a backscratching prostitute for hire...
        * Not every abused child goes on to abuse their own child...
        * At some point you have be responsible for the influence you receive
        * But also for the influence you exercise.
    * [ no keyhole ]  
      * Well, that's embarrassing. Let me fix that for you.
  * [ rewind ]
  * Well, go ahead, give me a hand. I'll fix that right up for you.

## Segment 2

#### Scene
  * the door now has a key hole on it
  * the room remains the same

#### Content
  * Well, hello princess. Nice of you to join me.
  * Formalities out of the way, yes?
  * [ interrupt | check door | ... ]
    * [ check room item | ... ]
      * The strong, silent type.
      * I can work with that.
      * So, you're trapped in a room, clearly at the mercy of the wrong type of person.
      * There is only one way out and the key to getting out is in this room.   
      * Influence. I hear you're a fan.
      * It's curious what we do with it.
    * [ interrupt ]
      * Influence. I hear you're a fan.
      * It's curious what we do with it.
      * Like the notion that shouting at me is going to change how this goes.
  * It's also curious what we do when our influence is subverted or, worse, completely undercut.
  * How does it feel?
  * [ go fuck yourself | let me out | ... ]
    * [ go fuck yourself ]
      * Very eloquent.
    * [ ... ]
      * Stoic in the face of adversity. Admirable. Really.
    * [ let me out ]
      * That rests with you. The exit is yours to take, not mine. Although...
  * It occurs to me, that in my haste, I may have left out some critical pieces.
  * It seems ridiculous to expect you to solve an incomplete puzzle, doesn't it?
  * [ rewind ]

## Segment 3

#### Scene
  * added content, functional and decorative
  * not clear on what this is just yet

#### Content
  * Hello, princess. Nice of you to join me.
  * [ shut up | what do you want? | ... ]
    * [ shut up ]
      * It's really losing its charm already, isn't it?
      * I agree. It's a bit tired.
      * Doesn't matter. We're well on our way anyway.
    * [ what do you want? ]
      * What brings someone to a place like this?
      * What brings someone to bring someone to a place like this?
      * Take a minute. Consider it.
      * What have you done that would bring you to a place like this?
      * What have you done that would bring someone to bring you to a place like this?
      * I know what you're thinking... he can't possible know that.
      * You're here. So, somebody knows.  
    * [ ... ]
  * Now, if you don't mind, we haven't all day.
  * Please, feel free to figure it all out.
  * [ examine objects ]
  * It's here and, quite frankly, I'm a little disappointed it's taking you so long.
  * [ rewind ]

## Segment 4

#### Scene
  * back to the original scene
  * added contents have been removed
  * the key hole has been removed as well

#### Content
  * It's my little reality.
  * You think I'd be better at this.
  * It's so aggravating not being sure, you know.
  * Just not quite fucking getting it.
  * So much of it is in my head that it is obvious.
  * I already know how this ends.
  * What I don't know is what's in your head.
  * Do you just not understand?
  * Don't you get it?
  * Then again, maybe you do?
  * Maybe.... maybe you're just fucking with me...
  * How many hoops will I jump through?
  * How much of your work will I do for you?
  * Maybe I did over complicate it.
  * It's hard to say.
  * Either way, we should really sort that out.
  * [ rewind ] >> forced / timed by game
  * Don't bother. I'll do it myself.

## Segment 5

#### Scene
  * the entire room has been stripped back
  * a single table with wooden box on it, closed
  * the box opens to a red velvet lined case
  * it contains a gun   

#### Content
  * I've decided it wasn't me, it was you.
  * So, I've pared things back a little.
  * Go on. It's there just for you.
  * [ what's on the other side of the door | examine box ]
    * [ what's on the other side of the door ]
     * nothing you need to worry about just yet
    * [ examine box ]
      * Congratulations, you've found the key that leads to your exit.
      * Hurry now, before the excitement fades.
  * [ rewind ]

## Segment 6

#### Scene
  * progressive removal of elements on successive rewinds
  * the box, the table, the door, all decorative elements
  * ultimately a white room with a gun on the floor

#### Content

  * You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?
  * I can assure you, whatever control you think you have in this situation is an illusion.
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
    * Oh. No. That didn't fix it.
    * Maybe the next try? Perhaps?
    * You could give it a go, of course.
    * Or you could do what you know is right.
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
    * Just do it!
    * You wanted out. There's the exit.
    * If someone was in the way of you getting out and you had that in your hand you do whatever you needed to do to get them out of your way.
    * You're in the way.
    * Do what you need to do.
    * Take the exit.
  * [ rewind | take the exit ]
    * You take as long as I need. I've got as much time as you've got.
    * Substantially more, truth be told.
    * I think,
  * [ take the exit ]
