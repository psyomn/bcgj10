        It's the kind of experiment you couldn't really do today. Not in the the
        light, at least.  It still amuses how recent some of psychological
        transgressions are. Anyway, simple experiment.  Students were brought in
        to set up a mock prison. Some of the student were prisoners and others
        were guards.  The professor running the experiment placed himself in the
        role as warden. In retrospect, it's fairly unsurprising how quickly it
