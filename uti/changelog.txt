===== Version 0.4.x =====

==== Version 0.4.0 ====

  * Implemented anchors for displayable objects to be able to better position them on stage.
  * Fixed: When saving an imagepack that had no image set and then setting the same image that was set before loading resulted in the infamous "Trying to set an image that is already set" warning and so the image was never shown.

==== Version 0.3.7 ====

Released on 2013-11-01.

  * Fixed: wait command ignored duration= attribute.

==== Version 0.3.6 ====

==== Version 0.3.5 ====

Released on 2013-10-29.

  * Added more options for variables.

    duration of the fade effect between lines. Default is 0 now (no fade).

==== Version 0.3.4 ====

Released on 2013-10-18.

  * Fixed: When loading a savegame, some images on Imagepacks got stuck.

==== Version 0.3.3 ====

Released on 2013-10-12.

  * Fixed: When using the set command with duration 0, the duration was instead set to the default.

==== Version 0.3.2 ====

Released on 2013-08-10.

  * Fixed: When using a var command inside of a choice command, any ifvar or ifvalue attributes were ignored.

==== Version 0.3.1 ====

Released on 2013-08-04.

  * Fixed a bug with the savegame system: audio was not restored after loading a savegame. Also, when loading an asset fails the other assets are not affected by it. Savegames made with 0.3.0 should still work with this release.

==== Version 0.3.0 ====

  * Better support for %, e.g. to allow WebStories with fluid stage dimensions.
  * New Background asset that stretches to fit the stage.
  * Engine split into separate files for development to be more modular.
  * Alpha support for local container apps.
  * WSE object gets it's own data bus, to allow obtaining game and interpreter references at startup.
  * Textbox asset gets an HTML-aware typewriter effect.
  * Use HTML in <line> commands directly, without the ugy {tag} syntax.
  * New side images extension.
  * Updated savegame API to make it more robust and easier to use. Also fixes: [[https://github.com/jsteinbeck/WebStory-Engine/issues/4|GitHub issue #4]]
  * Extend the Textbox definition with a <nameTemplate> element, in which {name} will be replaced by the name of the character who's speaking, if any.
  * Rename attribute 'names' on Textbox definitions to 'namebox'. The old attribute name was much too confusing.
